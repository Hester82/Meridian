      <h4 class="head4">Welcome to Meridian Park!</h4>
      <p class="black16">We are glad you have chosen our community to call home. To ensure that you have a pleasant rental experience, we have put together this packet providing you with some pertinent information such as what to do in an emergency, what to do when leaving for an extended period of time, rules and policies of the community, and some helpful hints for your apartment. We hope you find it useful and please feel free to call the office with any questions or comments.</p>

      <h4><a href="#Anchor-Office-49575">Office Hours</a></h4>
  	<p class="contact3">Monday - Friday 8:30am - 5:30pm<br>
  	Saturday - 12pm - 5pm<br>
     <a href="tel:+1-252-321-1948"><a class="meridian">Telephone: 252-321-1948</a><br>
      FAX: 252-321-9206</p>
      <h4 class="left"><a id="Anchor-When-47857"></a>Information</h4>
  	<p class="black16">When you move into your new home you will be given a Resident Move-In Checklist and a Parking Registration.  Please fill these out completely and return to the office as soon as possible.  The Checklist is for you to note any pre-existing damages in the apartment.  By noting these, we can promptly fix these problems.  The Parking Registration is used to track which buildings may be having parking problems.</p>
  	<p class="black16">Once you settle in, should a maintenance problem occur, please call the office immediately so that we may service your request as quickly as possible.  As stated in your lease, it is the leaseholder’s responsibility to notify the office of any service requests that you have.  Should something occur after office hours you may call the office and our answering service will be happy to direct your call.  You may submit an online maintenance request form by visiting our website at <a href="http://www.meridianpark.net">www.meridianpark.net</a>.  You can also fill out a maintenance request form found on the bulletin board in the clubhouse or in the fitness room and place it in our convenient drop box.</p>
  	<p class="black16">We issue parking permits to our residents and ask that you read the parking guidelines included in your move in package and call the office with any questions you have regarding these guidelines.</p>
  	<p class="black16">Meridian Park publishes and delivers a monthly newsletter that notifies our residents of any community events and reminders you should be aware of.  It is packed with useful information that is beneficial while you stay at Meridian Park and in Greenville.</p>
  	<p class="black16">Everyone is looking for a way to make his or her life easier.  One way is to sign up for the Tenant Portal.  Instead of dropping off a check every month, you just log on to your account and pay online.  You can even put in a non-emergency work order.  For those that are not quite ready to pay your rent online, we have a late night drop box located in the front of the clubhouse where you can drop off your rent, keys, or letters of correspondence.</p>
  	<p class="black16">Clean air is a must and in order to keep your air conditioner and heater in good working condition, it’s been said to change your air filters every 1-3 months depending on if you have allergies, pets or even on the season.  So as a courtesy we will change your air filter twice a year.  We will give you adequate notice via our newsletter so that you will know approximately which week someone will be entering your apartment. As an additional courtesy you may call the office and we will bring you air filters as needed.  </p>
  	<p class="black16">When operating the garbage disposal in your apartment, please remember to run the warm water. This will prevent the food from jamming the system. Please DO NOT put grease, bones, or any other hard objects in the disposal, if you can’t chew it neither can the disposal! There will be a $45 service charge for any maintenance calls regarding improper use of garbage disposals. Should the disposal give off an unpleasant odor lemon juice or baking soda will freshen it right up! Also make sure the disposal is clear when running your dishwasher, this will prevent food from the disposal entering your washer while in process.</p>
  	<p class="black16">To increase the efficiency of your dryer and cut down on your utility bill, make sure to clean the lint filter after every load. The build up of lint will force the dryer to work harder!</p>
  	<p class="black16">To reduce the maintenance problems that may arise in your bathroom, we ask that you not flush feminine products, paper towels, or cat litter down the toilet. If you do not have a plunger please purchase one prior to calling the office. If we are able to unclog the line or we have to call a plumber to unclog the line and it because of these products, you will be charged $45 and up, pending service fees.</p>
